In this activity I learned a lot of terms used in phyhton. 
first thing is i installed the matplotlib
then after is I wrote/code write to file in order to connect txt
then i code all of the expressions and decisions
after that generate the x values using numpy
then listed all expressions
then display available expressions
after that is the code for asking the user to choose one expression or solve all
and the loop after that is print.
